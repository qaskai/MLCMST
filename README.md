### Dependencies
- CMake >= 3.16
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2 "Catch2") (downloaded by CMake)
- [or-tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools "or-tools") (downloaded by CMake)
- [glog](https://github.com/google/glog "glog") (downloaded by CMake)
- [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts.git, "cxxopts") (downloaded by CMake)

### Build
When in project root run the following.
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```
Application binaries will be placed in `./build/app/`, test binaries go to `./build/tests/`.

When new files are added to the project, `cmake -S . -B build` always needs to be run, as CMake makes a file list in
configure time and only tracks changes in those files. When files are only updated this command can be skipped.

If CMake crashes with errors related to or-tools dependencies, try adding `-DBUILD_DEPS=ON`.

### Testing
Tests can be run through Catch binary 
`./build/tests/mlcmst_tests` - [option docs](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md#top "option docs").
Another option is to run them with CMake - `cmake --build build -t test`.

### Apps

The project provides three apps. They will be generated by build in `<build_path>/app/` directory. Their purpose is
briefly described here. For further usage information please run `<app_path> -h`.

- `generation` - generates MLCCNetwork instances, according to provided specification 
- `test_case_wrapper` - wraps MLCCNetwork instances with lower bound for MLCMST solutions, outputs test cases
- `benchmark` - runs specified solvers on provided test cases and presents gathered statistics


### Todo
- implementation of MLCMST heuristics and LP formulations (various),
 [this](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~raghavan/preprints/mlcmst.pdf "this") will go first
- collect, describe and classify heuristics and LP formulations in a paper
